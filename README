PROBLEM: SegFault
When running mhd3d with a large grid or high SH fit resolution it may cause a segfault since the variables are auto-assigned to the stack. The stack will have a pre-defined size and if this is exceeded the program will segFault. To bypass this error execute the following at the bash/sh/ksh terminal you are running the code from:

ulimit -s unlimited
